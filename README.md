_Calculator Project_


_Description_


A simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


_Features_


- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, x, /)
- Clear function (AC)
- Delete function (backspace)
- Negative number function (±)
- Display screen to show calculations and results


_Technologies Used_


- HTML5 for structure and content
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- JavaScript for functionality and calculations


_Files_


- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the calculator
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the calculator
- `calc.js`: The JavaScript file for calculator functionality


_Usage_


1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to use the calculator.
2. Enter numbers and operators using the keypad.
3. Press the "=" button to calculate the result.
4. Use the "AC" button to clear the display.
5. Use the "±" button to toggle negative numbers.
6. Use the backspace button to delete the last entered digit.


_Known Issues_


- Problem with changing operators: The calculator does not handle operator changes correctly.
- Multiplication and division only work between two operands: The calculator does not support multiple operands for multiplication and division.


_Future Development_


- Add more advanced mathematical functions (e.g., trigonometry, logarithms, exponentials)
- Fix bugs and improve functionality
- Improve user interface and design
- Add support for keyboard input
- Implement memory storage for calculations
